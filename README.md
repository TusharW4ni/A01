<!-- # Setup

### Run Part 1

1. Open a new google colab notebook
2. Paste code
3. Tap run
4. Graphs and statistce values will output
5. Adjust learning rate (alpha) and iterations accordingly


### Run Part 2

1. `python3 part2.py`

- It takes a while to finish processing
- When done it should print "Log file has been saved" along with a matplotlib warning of being unable to perfrom plt.show()
- This should give you a part2_log.txt file with the output
- This output and the graph generated by matplotlib are pasted in the report document -->

# Files

1. part1.py
2. part2.py
3. report.docx
4. requirements.txt
5. README.md

# Setup

It will be the easiest to run the code on something like Google Colab. When running these files locally without an interactive python environment will not show the plots. Therefore, we recommend using google colab. You can copy and paste the code from these files into colab. However, we have the code pasted in colab for you.

The same plots and log data is in the report.docx file.

### Local Setup
If you want to run this locally (keeping in mind that the plots will not show up) you can follow these steps:


1. Make a new virtual environment <br />
   `python3 -m venv .venv`
2. Activate the virtual environment <br />
   `source ./.venv/bin/activate` <br />

- To turn the virtual environment off <br />
  `deactivate`

3. Inside activated virtual environment run <br />
   `pip install -r ./requirements.txt`

To run the files then you can do `python3 part1.py` and `python3 part2.py`
