# Setup

It will be the easiest to run the code on something like Google Colab. When running these files locally without an interactive python environment will not show the plots. Therefore, we recommend using google colab. You can copy and paste the code from these files into colab. However, we have the code pasted in colab for you.

The same plots and log data is in the report.pdf file.
