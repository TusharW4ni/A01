Are you satisfied that the package has found the best solution? Explain.

Yes, the gradient descent implementation has converged to a solution where the cost function (MSE) has been minimized.
The R^2 score indicates how well the model predicts the target variable. Depending on the score, further tuning of
learning rate and iterations might be required for better performance.
